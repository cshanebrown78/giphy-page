# giphy-page

This is my sixth homework assignment for my coding bootcamp class and focuses on the use of APIs.

## How to use the page:

* The page will open with a number of buttons related to aircraft populated at the top.  

* Click any of the buttons and it will generate a maximum of 10 gifs on the page.  It may be fewer if it can't find 10 gifs.  

* These gifs will be paused on the initial load but by clicking on one you can animate it.  If you click it again you will pause it.

* There is also a place to add another aircraft button or other interest.  This button can then be clicked the same as the others.

## Have fun on the page
